# Writing Emails

To: Alice

Subject: Bob explaining reasons **for** a raise

​    Dear Alice: 

​    You told me last Thursday I did not get a raise because I had missed eight days of work during the year. I should have talked about it with you earlier. **In this email, I'm writing to** clarify the reasons why I deserve one.<sub>陈述</sub>

​    Firstly, I did miss the training sessions, but I was out of town on a job-related assignment for one of those sessions, which I did not realize I should tell the HR in time. It was my fault.

  Secondly, I missed eight days of work, but I'm allowed five days of sick leave as part of my contract. The other three days missed were due to having to stay home to take care of my sick children, which I think can be covered by the company's parental leave policy. 

Finally, I don’t think employees should be required to work beyond their contractual 40 hours for rush jobs. If they do need to do so, there should be an overtime pay.

  Alice, **please** think about it again. **I'd appreciate it** if you can reply soon. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Thank you SO much for your time.

  Yours,

Bob
